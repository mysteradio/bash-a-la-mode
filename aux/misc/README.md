# bash-a-la-mode
a collection of BASH scripts that make my CLI life a little easier

* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* SOME OF THESE SCRIPTS MAY BE USEFUL TO OTHERS! i'll keep a list of them below for the curious:
* 
* >> template -- i think it's a good template for a BASH script, i think.
* >> list -- list contents with of a directory in a handy way with mnemonic options 
* >> mp3 -- download the audio from a youtube video as an mp3 using youtube-dl with option to rename the file in one fell swoop.
* >> duck -- open duckduckgo search page in lynx (hopefully i'll learn how to pass a string to the script with a search query!)
* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'bashketball' is my BASH study directory. nothing much to see there.

the 'inactive' directory is where i'll move scripts that i longer use but that i don't want to delete yet for whatever reason.

ok. this seems to be enough explanatory story for the lorry. now to get truckin.

may your best of wishes come true!
