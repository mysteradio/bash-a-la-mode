# bash-a-la-mode
a collection of scripts that make my CLI life a little easier on BASH 

hello and welcome :) these are my personal scripts, ones i use on every BASHy machine i get my hands on. i hope to use GIT to keep all my computers up to speed on my shenanigans, so to speak. 

PLEASE NOTE:

* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* some of these scripts are for laptops (like toff, 'touchpad off')
* some are very personal (like tara, which i use to display a Buddhist image in full screen)
* some are only for my machine(s) (like tank, which i use to mount a partition of my hdd)
* some are works in progress (aren't we all?)
* and some are just seedlings that are unlikely to sprout into anything particularly fruitful BUT . . .
* SOME OF THESE SCRIPTS MAY BE USEFUL TO OTHERS! i'll keep a list of them below for the curious:
* 
* >> template -- i think it's a good template for a BASH script, i think.
* >> list -- list contents of working directory using ls -Xlh --color. can pass 'all' as an argument to show hidden files, too.
* >> mp3 -- download the audio from a youtube video as an mp3 using youtube-dl with option to rename the file in one fell swoop.
* >> duck -- open duckduckgo search page in lynx (hopefully i'll learn how to pass a string to the script with a search query!)
* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'bashketball' is my BASH study directory. nothing much to see there.

the 'inactive' directory is where i'll move scripts that i longer use but that i don't want to delete yet for whatever reason.

ok. this seems to be enough explanatory story for the lorry. now to get truckin.

may your best of wishes come true!
